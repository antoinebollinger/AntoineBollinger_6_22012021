# Openclassrooms Project #6: Build a Secure API for a Review App 

What I used: Node.js, Express, MongoDB.

## Getting started

Clone the project on your local machine.

Before you start, make sure you have a account at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). You'll have to create a ```.env``` file a the root of your project, with:

```
MONGOLAB_URI=the uri to your mongodb database
```

Then you can go with:

```
npm install
node server
```

The API should run on ```http://localhost:3000/```.
